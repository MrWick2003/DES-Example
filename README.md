# DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key block cipher, which means it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext and uses a 56-bit key (with 8 parity bits, making it 64 bits total). DES performs 16 rounds of encryption, using the Feistel structure. The code presented implements a simplified version of DES in pure Python for educational purposes.

Detailed Explanation of DES (Data Encryption Standard) in Python:-
The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 64-bit key (56 effective bits and 8 parity bits). It is structured around 16 rounds of encryption based on the Feistel network, a model that splits data into two halves and applies a series of transformations to produce ciphertext. The Python code provided is a simplified educational implementation of DES, designed to illustrate the internal mechanics rather than serve as a production-grade encryption system.

The algorithm begins by converting the input plaintext and key into binary bit arrays. It then applies an initial permutation (IP) to the 64-bit plaintext, rearranging the bits in a predefined pattern. This permuted block is divided into left and right halves of 32 bits each. For each of the 16 rounds, the right half is expanded to 48 bits using an expansion table, then XORed with a round key. In this simplified implementation, the same key is reused for all rounds, whereas the full DES algorithm would generate a unique subkey for each round using a key schedule.

Following the XOR step, the data passes through a substitution box (S-box), which replaces fixed-length input bits with output bits in a non-linear manner. This step introduces non-linearity and increases security. Although standard DES uses eight different S-boxes, the simplified version uses only one for demonstration purposes. The output of the S-box is permuted again using a P-box (permutation table) and then XORed with the left half of the data. The two halves are swapped, and the process repeats for 16 rounds.

After the final round, the left and right halves are combined (not swapped in the final step, as is customary in DES) and passed through the inverse initial permutation (IP⁻¹), which reverses the first permutation applied. The resulting bit array is then converted back into characters. Since the output is raw binary data, it may contain non-printable or unreadable characters. To make the output more user-friendly, it is often encoded in hexadecimal or base64 formats.

User input to the program includes an 8-character plaintext string and an 8-character key, both of which are converted to binary form for processing. The encryption function returns a ciphertext, which may appear garbled due to its binary nature but is a direct representation of the encrypted block. This code serves as an educational demonstration of DES, helping learners understand core concepts such as permutations, bitwise operations, and the structure of block ciphers.

Although historically significant, DES is no longer considered secure for modern cryptographic applications due to its relatively small key size, which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It has been largely replaced by more secure standards such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Nonetheless, DES remains a foundational algorithm for understanding the principles of symmetric encryption and is often studied in computer security and cryptography courses.
